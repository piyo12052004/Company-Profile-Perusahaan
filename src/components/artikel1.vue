                        Currently, the Indonesian government requires buildings, especially factories, to take care of SLF or certificate of fitness for function. SLF is a certificate issued by the local government for buildings that have been completed according to the IMB and have met the technical feasibility requirements according to the function of the building based on the results of the inspection from the building expert team or SLF consultant services.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; ">
                        The main purpose of issuing a certificate of functional fitness is as a requirement for the use of buildings. In addition, the existence of a functional fitness certificate can be interpreted as the building you are using has been tested for reliability.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; ">
                        However, before we discuss the obligation to manage a certificate of fitness for factory buildings, there are important points that you must pay attention to. For that, see this article to the end!

                        As previously explained, the management of functional fitness certificates has been regulated by the Indonesian government through clear laws and regulations. The laws and regulations regarding the obligation to manage a certificate of fitness for function are as follows:

                    <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">In order for the local government to issue an SLF for your factory, there are two main requirements that must be met. First, are administrative requirements. Second, is the technical requirements of the building.</p>

                        The technical requirements for building buildings that will be requested by the local government when you take care of the issuance of a factory functional fitness certificate are as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <ul class="space-y-4 text-gray-900 list-disc list-inside dark:text-gray-900">

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, the procedures for checking the feasibility of building functions that are usually carried out by SLF consultants are as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <ul class="space-y-4 text-gray-900 list-disc list-inside dark:text-gray-900">

                            <li>The process of preparing a report on the feasibility of building functions.</li>

                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Usually, the analysis and evaluation process required by the team of building experts from SLF consultants takes quite a long time, depending on the size and function of the building. In this analysis and evaluation process, there are at least 6 (six) stages. The explanation is as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <ul class="space-y-4 text-gray-900 list-disc list-inside dark:text-gray-900">
                        <ol class="ps-5 mt-2 space-y-1 list-decimal list-inside">
                            <li> SLF consultants or technical assessors will assess the suitability of the specifications and quality of construction implementation at each stage of work to the technical plan document of the building as an attachment to the IMB document (building permit).</li>
                            <li>Furthermore, examine the suitability of built drawings or as built drawings of buildings. If you do not have as built drawings, you can consult directly through the SLF consultants involved.</li>
                            <li>Reviewing the fulfillment of technical recommendations from the relevant regional apparatus.</li>
                            <li>Assess the conformity of material test results to technical specifications in the building technical plan document.</li>
                            <li>Assess the suitability of the results of testing and testing of building equipment/equipment.</li>
                            <li>Finally, the SLF consultant will review the conformity of the technical specifications in the building's operation, maintenance, and maintenance manual.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                        The building functional feasibility inspection report prepared by a team of building experts will contain a list of the results of the building functional feasibility inspection. If the results of the inspection report state that the building is functional, the SLF consultant will provide you with a statement of the building's functional feasibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, if the results of the functional feasibility check state that the building is not functional, the SLF consultant will provide recommendations for repairs in accordance with the technical plan document of the building.

                        A factory is a large industrial building used by workers to process goods or supervise the working process of machines from one product to another so that it has added value. In Indonesia itself, the term factory is also often referred to as an industrial building.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                        Complementing the definition above, according to the Regulation of the Minister of Industry of the Republic of Indonesia Number 64/M-ID/PER/7/2016, the classification of industries in Indonesia can be seen based on the number of workers and the value of investment.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                       1. Small industry, is an industry that employs a maximum of 19 (nineteen) workers and has an investment value of less than 1 (one) billion rupiah (excluding land and buildings where the business is located). <br>
                        2. Medium industry, is an industry that employs a maximum of 19 (nineteen) workers and has an investment value of at least 1 (one) billion rupiah or employs at least 20 (twenty) workers and has an investment value of at most 15 (fifteen) billion rupiah.<br>
                        3. Large industries are industries that employ at least 20 (twenty) workers and have an investment value of more than 15 (fifteen) billion rupiah.<br>

                        One of the importance of SLF for buildings is to ensure that every work machine can operate normally and is maintained regularly
                    </p>
                    <p class="titleartikel6">
                        Why is SLF for factories important?
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                        Why is SLF important? The older the factory and its machines, the more often problems will arise. For example, the fragility of the walls due to the aging of the factory, the non-functioning of the system and fire alarm when there is a blaze in the workspace, or other problems that often arise without being predictable.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                        To suppress and minimize work accidents that can take lives, the government organizes and fosters the implementation of building buildings through the management of factory SLFs. The regulation contained in the legislation explains that the benchmark for the reliability of buildings used as factories can be seen from the existence of SLF or certificate of functional fitness.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                        The validity period of the certificate of functional fitness for the factory has also been determined, namely for 5 (five years). That way, before the validity period of the factory SLF expires, you must apply for an extension of the certificate of functional fitness by completing several documents that have been required.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                        On the other hand, there are several benefits when a factory that is still actively operating has a certificate of functional fitness. The benefits of SLF for factories are as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">

                        <ol class="ps-5 mt-2 space-y-1 list-decimal list-inside">
                            <li> Realizing a factory building that is functionally fit and has a building layout that is harmonious and in harmony with the environment.</li>
                            <li>Realizing order in the implementation of factory buildings to ensure reliability, both in terms of safety, health, comfort, and convenience.</li>
                            <li>Realizing legal certainty in the implementation of building buildings.</li>

                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                        So, that's an explanation of the importance of SLF or certificate of functional fitness for factory buildings that are still actively operating. If you are having trouble finding an SLF service provider in your city, using our services is the right choice.
